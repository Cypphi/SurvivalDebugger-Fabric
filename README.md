# Survival Debugger
Simple mod allowing you to use debug sticks in survival.

## Disclaimer
I do not provide any support for this mod as it was created for personal usage. This is a more simplified version which does not include a recipe to craft a debug stick in survival. This mod assumes you already have one through any of the countless ways of getting one in survival, creative or with commands.
For ways to obtain a debug stick in survival check out this [amazing community](https://discord.gg/KXTaEftvj9).
